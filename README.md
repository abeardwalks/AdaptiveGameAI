### What is this repository for? ###

BSc Software Engineering Final Year Project, 

### What is the project? ###

I developed AI for a game called [Nine Men's Morris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_Men's_Morris), with the main premise of 'Being a Good Dad'. Remember being a child and playing your dad at Chess? I do, I also remember the way he played. He wouldn't let me win easily, nor would he thrash me. He would match my skill level and ensure the game was challenging but ultimately fun. 

My AI captures this idea and pushes towards an even game. This idea of an even was introduced by [Pieter Spronck](http://ilk.uvt.nl/~pspronck/). The idea being that a game that is close with no clear winner until the end is more exciting and fun to play. 

The project was successful and helped secure myself a First Class Honours in Software Engineering at the University of Strathclyde.
